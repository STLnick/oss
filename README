Version Control:
GitHub repo: https://github.com/STLnick/oss

To run the program:
First run 'make' to build 'oss' and 'user'

To execute with the sample data file run:

./oss -c 4 -l logfile -t 50

Where '-c 4' is the number of children to run at one time, '-l logfile' is the file oss will write to during execution,
and '-t 50' is the max amount of time that oss will run before terminating.

Program options:
  -h = HELP
  -c = The total number of children to run at any one time.
  -l = The file for oss to write output to.
  -t = The time in seconds that the program will execute. This will end
       execution even if the processes haven't finished the tasks.


Default value information:
  All options specified above are optional and will use the
  following default values if not specified.
  -c = 5
  -l = output.log
  -t = 20

  NOTE: Any Negative values passed will be set to these default values
        Any excessive values will be set to a ceiling value.
