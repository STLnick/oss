******** NOTICE ********

This program does not execute properly! I ran into issues and quite frankly dropped the ball on consistently working on this project to remedy them in time. After the extension and past it I became more complacent. 

This program will flood the server with processes (hence why I emailed you Mark on removing them)!

I'm simply documenting and submitting this, even mulitple days late, to give myself peace of mind. And to potentially get a scrap or two of points instead of a 0 on this project.

************************


To run the program:
First run 'make' to build 'oss' and 'user'

To execute with the sample data file run:

./oss -c 4 -l logfile -t 50

Where '-c 4' is the number of children to run at one time, '-l logfile' is the file oss will write to during execution,
and '-t 50' is the max amount of time that oss will run before terminating.

Program options:
  -h = HELP
  -c = The total number of children to run at any one time.
  -l = The file for oss to write output to.
  -t = The time in seconds that the program will execute. This will end
       execution even if the processes haven't finished the tasks.


Default value information:
  All options specified above are optional and will use the
  following default values if not specified.
  -c = 5
  -l = output.log
  -t = 20

  NOTE: Any Negative values passed will be set to these default values
        Any excessive values will be set to a ceiling value.


What Works:
- Makefile
- Parsing command line options and enforcing sensible values/defaults
- Sending and Receiving a message in queue between oss.c and user.c


What Doesn't Work:
- Fork crashes program and spins off too many processes without ending them properly
- Program timer is not setup to stop execution after time elapsed
- oss.c does not write to logfile
- user.c generates a random runtime for itself but does not enfoce it properly i.e. user never terminates
- Signal handling is not implemented


Uncertainties:
